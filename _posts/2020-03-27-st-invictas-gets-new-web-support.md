St Invicta's are delighted to announce that we've signed up to the Web Support Service from East Sussex County Council.

The team will improve our web content and provide us a new template website, which looks brilliant.

As part of this service they will:

1. Audit our content to make sure it meets the latest web standards
2. Maintain our website going forward, responding to updates when requested
3. Advise on Ofsted requirements and make sure we're aware of what we need to put online.
