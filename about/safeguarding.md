This is where you edit the text. Make sure pages are all markdown and then the team can update them.

This page can be cloned and edited to have a new URL, which I think is the easiest way for the team and clients to manage it.

Sample client update - they can edit markdown pages too.

> Blockquotes in markup too?

### Bullets

They can add these to:

* emphasise text
* do other stuff
* shame about the gap

[Add links to other pages.](/about/governors/)

##### Smaller header

With some more regular text.
