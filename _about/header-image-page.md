      Some text here to come up as the content of the main page. I've added the
      image in the front matter, but it will only show if the page layout is
      'header image'. Got to figure out if that's the best way or if there's
      some if...else that can be done to hide the normal h1 tag.

description: Test to see if the image loads properly.
