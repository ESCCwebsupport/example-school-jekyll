Sport is a big deal here at St Invicta's. We want our pupils to have fun and compete should they wish.

Some recent school successes are: Year 4s were runners-up in the yearly school cricket tournament. Harley from Year 3 won her cross-country run and qualified for a Sussex race.

Sport premium Schools receive funding to help with the provision of PE and sport, but we have some freedom to choose how we spend it.
