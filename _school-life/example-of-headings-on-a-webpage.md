This page shows how headings should be used on a website, in order to meet accessibility requirements.

## This is an H2 heading

Here is the first major section on your webpage. If you need each section broken into smaller ones, then you should use the next heading down.

### This is an H3 heading

The content here related to the major H2 heading. If we were starting another major section here, we would have used an H2 instead.

### Another H3 heading

This content is another subsection underneath our main H2. It has the same level of importance as the H3 above.

#### This is an H4 heading

If you then want to break down the subheadings further still, you should use an H4. This section is linked to the last H3 heading.

#### Another H4 heading

As above, this content is meant to be read underneath the last H3 and with the same level of importance as the H4.

## Now we can start another H2 heading

We got to the end of the last major section, which was broken into smaller H3 headings and one of those into H4s. This is a brand new major section of the page, so we start again with an H2.
