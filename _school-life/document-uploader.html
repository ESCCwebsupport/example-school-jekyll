  Take a look and see what document uploader does. If I remove and add a new one
  after saving does it add a new one?

<div class="container editable" data-i18n="{{ page.title | slugify }}_content">
            <p>Let's see if we can add multiple documents using the front matter field.</p>
            <p>Link to this <a href="/assets/media/document-uploader/ticket-id-174-print--20-07-2018--200540--hastings-united-football-club.pdf">first uploaded PDF</a>. Then add some more text to fill up the column and overflow to the next one, because I want to see how it looks when there's an image and the text goes onto a second page.</p>
            <p>Try in a second <a href="/assets/media/document/food.docx">with another one</a>.</p>
