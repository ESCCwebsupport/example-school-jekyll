      Landmarks provide a powerful way to identify the organization and
      structure of a web page. The structural information conveyed visually to
      users should be represented programmatically in the markup using landmark
      roles. The use of landmarks roles support keyboard navigation to the
      structure of a web page for screen reader users, and can be used as
      targets for author supplied "skip links" and browser extensions for
      enhanced keyboard navigation.

      This section is intended to assist designers, developers and quality
      assurance staff in defining and understanding the importance of logical,
      usable, and accessible layout for assistive technologies using HTML
      sectioning elements and ARIA landmark roles.

      * Break the page into perceivable areas called "areas".

      * Typically, designers indicate areas visually using alignment and spacing
      of content.

      * Regions can be further defined into logical sub-areas as needed.

      * An example of a sub-area is a portlet in a portal application.

Due to the complexity of today's web content, if using landmarks,&nbsp;**all perceivable content**&nbsp;should reside in a semantically meaningful landmark in order that content is not missed by the user.
